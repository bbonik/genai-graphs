# Automatic generation of visual summaries using GenAI
One image is a 1000 words! This app puts this saying in to practice. It captures the text of a webpage, and it generates a **visual graph representing the summary of the text**. Taking a glance at this 'Visual Gist', will help you understand the main content without having to actually read the whole webpage. The generated content is a rich visual representation of the text and can be used to enrich the given text.
