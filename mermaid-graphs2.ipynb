To help with this, we've provided a `get_bedrock_client()` utility method that supports passing in different options. You can find the implementation in [../utils/bedrock.py](../utils/bedrock.py)\n",

The actions for [`InvokeModel`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html) and [`InvokeModelWithResponseStream`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModelWithResponseStream.html) are supported by Amazon Bedrock Runtime where as other operations, such as [ListFoundationModels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListFoundationModels.html), are handled via [Amazon Bedrock client](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_Operations_Amazon_Bedrock.html).\n",

This is also the case if you are running these notebooks from a computer whose default AWS credentials have access to Bedrock.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a different AWS Region\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this notebook from your own computer or a SageMaker notebook in a different AWS Region from where Bedrock is set up, you can un-comment the `os.environ['AWS_DEFAULT_REGION']` line below and specify the region to use.\n",

    "In case you're running this notebook from your own computer where you have setup the AWS CLI with multiple profiles, and the profile which has access to Bedrock is not the default one, you can un-comment the `os.environ['AWS_PROFILE']` line below and specify the profile to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use a different role\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you or your company has setup a specific, separate [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) to access Bedrock, you can specify it by un-commenting the `os.environ['BEDROCK_ASSUME_ROLE']` line below.

    "## Common inference parameter definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomness and Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundation models support the following parameters to control randomness and diversity in the \n",
    "response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Temperature** – Large language models use probability to construct the words in a sequence. For any \n",
    "given next word, there is a probability distribution of options for the next word in the sequence. When \n",
    "you set the temperature closer to zero, the model tends to select the higher-probability words. When \n",
    "you set the temperature further away from zero, the model may select a lower-probability word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms, the temperature modulates the probability density function for the next tokens, \n",
    "implementing the temperature sampling technique. This parameter can deepen or flatten the density \n",
    "function curve. A lower value results in a steeper curve with more deterministic responses, and a higher \n",
    "value results in a flatter curve with more random responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top K** – Temperature defines the probability distribution of potential words, and Top K defines the cut \n",
    "off where the model no longer selects the words. For example, if K=50, the model selects from 50 of the \n",
    "most probable words that could be next in a given sequence. This reduces the probability that an unusual \n",
    "word gets selected next in a sequence.\n",
    "In technical terms, Top K is the number of the highest-probability vocabulary tokens to keep for Top-\n",
    "K-filtering - This limits the distribution of probable tokens, so the model chooses one of the highest-\n",
    "probability tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top P** – Top P defines a cut off based on the sum of probabilities of the potential choices. If you set Top \n",
    "P below 1.0, the model considers the most probable options and ignores less probable ones. Top P is \n",
    "similar to Top K, but instead of capping the number of choices, it caps choices based on the sum of their \n",
    "probabilities.\n",
    "For the example prompt \"I hear the hoof beats of ,\" you may want the model to provide \"horses,\" \n",
    "\"zebras\" or \"unicorns\" as the next word. If you set the temperature to its maximum, without capping \n",
    "Top K or Top P, you increase the probability of getting unusual results such as \"unicorns.\" If you set the \n",
    "temperature to 0, you increase the probability of \"horses.\" If you set a high temperature and set Top K or \n",
    "Top P to the maximum, you increase the probability of \"horses\" or \"zebras,\" and decrease the probability \n",
    "of \"unicorns.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Length\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters control the length of the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response length** – Configures the minimum and maximum number of tokens to use in the generated \n",
    "response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Length penalty** – Length penalty optimizes the model to be more concise in its output by penalizing \n",
    "longer responses. Length penalty differs from response length as the response length is a hard cut off for \n",
    "the minimum or maximum response length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In technical terms, the length penalty penalizes the model exponentially for lengthy responses. 0.0 \n",
    "means no penalty. Set a value less than 0.0 for the model to generate longer sequences, or set a value \n",
    "greater than 0.0 for the model to produce shorter sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Repetitions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following parameters help control repetition in the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repetition penalty (presence penalty)** – Prevents repetitions of the same words (tokens) in responses. \n",
    "1.0 means no penalty. Greater than 1.0 decreases repetition."
